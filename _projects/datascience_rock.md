# What is a good rock album?

Data science exploration of rock albums audio features & lyrics sentiment analysis.

>First, I gather data about the rock albums in the “Top 500 Albums of All Time” (Rolling Stone 2012); secondly, I apply different visualization and analysis techniques to this dataset with the objective of uncovering any substantial differences between the albums at the top of the chart and those at the bottom.
